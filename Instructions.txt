How to run this java application:
1. First thing to do is create a file in the directory of this application called APIKey.txt which should be a plain text file with only your Random.org API key in it.

2. Next run Ant to make the jar file.

3. Now just run the jar file like you normally would. Remember to keep APIKey.txt in the same directory as the jar file. For optional command line arguments see below.

Command line arguments:
-h 			for hex output (otherwise binary output)
-o "filename"		to output to a file
-n #			to specify how many random sets to generate
